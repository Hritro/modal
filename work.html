    Mariah Carey, singer
    Mariah Carey, singer
    "Never Forget You" is a song recorded by American singer Mariah Carey (pictured) for her third studio album Music
    Box. Carey co-wrote the slow jam with Babyface and the pair produced it with Daryl Simmons. Columbia Records
    released the song on January 21, 1994, as the B-side to "Without You" and promoted it to American urban contemporary
    radio stations as the album's fourth single. The lyrics lament the end of a romance. Strings, synthesizers, and
    percussion characterize the composition; Jermaine Dupri altered them for remixes. Music critics deemed "Never Forget
    You" unremarkable and derivative. The song peaked at numbers one and three on the US urban contemporary radio charts
    published by Radio & Records and the Gavin Report, respectively. It also reached number three on the Billboard Hot
    100 and number seven on the Billboard Hot R&B Singles chart. Combined with "Without You", the single sold 600,000
    copies in the US throughout 1994. (Full article...)

    Rose-ringed parakeet
    The rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri) is a medium-sized parrot in the family Psittacidae. It has disjunct
    native ranges in Africa and the Indian subcontinent, and has been introduced into many other parts of the world,
    including northern Europe, where feral populations have established themselves in urban areas and are bred for the
    exotic pet trade. Wild populations have a distinctive green colour, red beak and blue tail with adult males sporting
    a pink and black neck ring. This male rose-ringed parakeet of the subspecies P. k. borealis was photographed in
    Jaipur in Rajasthan, India.
